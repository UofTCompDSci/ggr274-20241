    "# GGR274H1 Final Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project for this course will use data science methods including programming and statistical analysis of data from [Ontario Community Health Profiles](https://www.ontariohealthprofiles.ca/dataTablesON.php?varTab=HPDtbl&select1=7) on one of the topics below.  You will present your findings via a five minute pre-recorded video, where you will present your work in the style of an oral presentation at an academic Data Science Conference (DSC).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and related data files that produced the slides for the pre-recorded video presentation, to be submitted before by **April 8, 23:59 (11:59 PM)** (extended from April 5). Submission details to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A 5 minute pre-recorded video presentation summarizing the work that you will give at the Data Science Conference (DSC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the Jupyter notebook and other files are submitted after the deadline you will lose 10% of your overall final project mark as long as they are submitted at most 24 hours after the deadline. The project files will not be accepted more than 24 hours after the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conference Slides\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should produce your conference slides using the Jupyter notebook Slideshow Extension RISE which is available on the [UofT Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca). The template of a Jupyter notebook document to produce the slides for your presentation is [here](extras/GGR274DSconfslides.ipynb).  You will be allowed to present **five** content slides (i.e., does not include slides to break up sections described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your presentation slides should include reproducible Python output (i.e., graphs, tables should be produced by Python code but not not hard-coded or inserted as an image), but not Python code unless it's directly related to one of the sections below.  See the [template](extras/GGR274DSconfslides.ipynb) and [tips](extras/Tipsandtricksforslides.ipynb) for an example of how to write code chunks to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your title slide must include your name, tutorial section (e.g., TUTXXXX), and the link to your presentation video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your slides should include the following sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "   + Introduction \n",
    "   + Methods\n",
    "   + Results \n",
    "   + Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few guidelines for an effective video presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your slides should be clear, concise, and easy to read quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not use small fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Figures often display information more efficiently than text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbered or bulleted lists convey points in slides more effectively than blocks of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Oral Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked to present your slides in a 5 minute pre-recorded video presentation that summarizes your work.  This time limit is firm and we will not view any content past 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not work with others in the class, as this is an individual project.  You may discuss the project with professors and the course TAs using office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Recording and Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, record your video presentation.\n",
    "   - You can refer to this [demo video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a974698e-fc08-4139-bc55-9462fc995d5e) regarding how to make this recording.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Upload your video recording to the University of Toronto MyMedia platform, <https://mymedia.library.utoronto.ca>.\n",
    "   - Martin has made another [demo video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/6984e115-7220-4ded-a8ba-73104152ccae?list=user&userId=0d2753fa-ab3f-4d15-9ce3-ebdec2290b82) for this step.\n",
    "3. After uploading the video, obtain the \"Permanent Link\" to the video but clicking on the \"Share\" button.\n",
    "    This link should look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    https://play.library.utoronto.ca/watch/1234567abcdefg...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add this URL to the top cell of your Jupyter notebook file, and clearly label it as the link to your presentation recording.\n",
    "5. Then, submit your Jupyter notebook file and all data used in your Jupyter notebook file to MarkUs under *project-submission: Project Final Submission*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Your TA will need to be able to see your full notebook file, run the code, and access the video URL, so please double-check notebook, data, and video before making your final submission!**\n",

    "## Data Analysis Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "You will carry out a data analysis on data from [Ontario Community Health Profiles](https://www.ontariohealthprofiles.ca/dataTablesON.php?varTab=HPDtbl&select1=7) using Python to address the topic below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that your analysis will require data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (plots and summary statistics), statistical tests and modeling.  Your project does not need to include all of these statistical methods nor does it need to include all of the variables in the data set.  You might also choose not to include all observations, or to make new variables from the data that may be more suitable for answering your questions of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to carry out an exhaustive analysis, nor to apply everything you have learned in the course.  The goal is to demonstrate that you have learned how to use Python, that you can appropriately apply the methods we have covered in class to address a question, and that you can effectively interpret and present the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Information about data from the [About Page from the Ontario Community Health Profiles website](https://www.ontariohealthprofiles.ca/aboutUsON.php):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Our overall goal is to support action to reduce health inequities in Ontario.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> How we achieve our goal: \n",
    "> Through our open-access, freely accessible website, we provide free health and socio-demographic data and maps for everyone to use, download, customize and share. Interactive functionality allows users the ability to view multiple variables on one map. A user guide provides guidance on navigation while methods documents fully describe data sources and analyses. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Our strategy:\n",
    "> - Provide health profiles of Ontario communities for Ontario communities with relevant and timely information in user-friendly format; \n",
    "> - Provide technical support and mechanisms for communities to access data;\n",
    "> - Conduct a series of workshops to foster access to and use of health data for decision-making, advocacy and policy, and to stimulate collaboration;\n",
    "> - Respond to the needs of users and adapt to new ways of providing data.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a wealth of information about health outcomes and socioeconomic characteristics, all summarized at the neighborhood level. These data come from a number of sources - e.g., socioeconomic data come from the Census, hospital admission data come from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, and chronic disease data come from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we give you\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a number of datasets with health and socioeconomic data at the Toronto Neighbourhood level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The health data include a dataset on adult health outcome (`AHD_2018-19_RPDB2019_neighb_Toronto.xlsx`), a dataset on preventive health care measures (`PR_2018-20_RPDB2019_neighb_TOR.xlsx`), and a dataset on emergency department visits (`EDC_2018-20_RPDB2019_neighb_All_HU_LU_TOR.xlsx`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The socioeconomic data include a dataset on income (`income_Toronto_2021_7.xlsx`), population characterstics(`population_characteristics_Toronto_2021_7.xlsx`), and a dataset on the households and dwellings characterstics (`housing_dwellings_Toronto_2021_7.xlsx`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete your project, you only _need_ to \"wrangle\" and analyze two of the above mentioned datasets, but you are also welcome to incorporate more than two datasets and to explore spatial patterns using the tools we learned in the last few weeks of class. A spatial file of Toronto Neighbourhoods that can be joined to the previously mentioned data is available as `Neighbourhoods.geojson`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data files are under `data` folder or avaiable [here](data/) (link only available when you open this notebook in JupyterHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to think about the data we have presented you and come up with your own question to answer, but a few questions are also provided below to help get you started. There are many ways you can address these questions in the data.  You will need to focus on your unique research question and make choices about what variables are important to _your_ question. You do not need to consider every variable in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few example questions that can inspire your project topics. These general questions will require you to decide which data to use to answer these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the relationships between sociodemographic and income variables and health outcomes? Using the dataset on emergency department visits, explore the following:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Classify neighbourhoods based on their income quintiles (5 groups, 20% each), and explore the demographics (e.g., living alone, language) within each group.\n",
    "    - Repeat the above by classifying neighbourhoods as quintiles by a sociodemographic variable of your choice, and summarize income.\n",
    "    - Analzye how high urgency and low urgency emergency department visits are associated with income and  sociodemographic variables. Is there an association between income and high (or low) urgency ED visits? \n",
    "    - If they exist, discuss why these relationships do or do not make sense; and if they don't exist what might be missing? You may need to do a little research to figure this part out. Cite your sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do certain adult health conditions (like asthma) have similar spatial patterns? (NB: some of the methods mentioned in this question will be covered later in the course)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Explore the geography of the adult asthma prevalence by mapping them using the libpysal and geopandas libraries. \n",
    "    - Use a measure of global spatial autocorrelation (for example Moran's I) to determine if the outcomes are actually spatially clustered.\n",
    "    - Use a spatial clustering tool (e.g., the Local G or LISA statistics we covered in class) to map where hot spots and cold spots of the diseases are.\n",
    "    - Compare the patterns and state whether you think there is significant overlap. If you can do this using code, all the better :). \n",
    "    - To go one step further, use the sociodemographic data to explore whether the disease maps correspond to patterns in sociodemographic variables (of your choosing). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are differences in the number of preventive procedures (e.g., mammograms, pap smears, etc.) by age group (as classified in the preventive health care measures dataset) related to different sociodemographic variables? \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The various preventive procedures in the dataset are broken down by various age groups (which vary some depending on the preventive procedures). Select the two procedures outlined in the dataset, and explore if older people participate in more preventive procedures than younger people.\n",
    "    - For the two procedures, calculate the differences in percent (e.g., % who had a mammogram) by age group for each neighbourhood. How different are these percentages, on average, for the procedures you picked? \n",
    "    - For each procedure, identify the neighbourhoods with the biggest absolute differences (use the top 10th percentile). How do sociodemographic variables in these neighbourhoods differ from neighbourhoods with smaller differences (aka the bottom 90th percentile)? \n",
    "    - Given what you've learned, discuss why you think these differences might exist. Feel free to create a map to help justify your explanation.\n"
