You can also embed text and plots in notebooks, which makes it a great medium for combining code and analysis. JupyterHub is the server on which we store Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

The first lab and homework will get you practice using notebooks on JupyterHub, and you'll develop more experience with these tools throughout this course.\n",
