    "- The test is divided into eight questions. Complete all questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The answers to the questions will be submitted on MarkUs using a similar workflow to the lab and homework assignments, except that MarkUs will not give you feedback on passing or failing the autotests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have provided some code to help you check your programming work in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answers where you are asked to write Python code will be autograded, and written answers will be graded manually by the teaching team.\n",

    "- You are allowed to use any materials from the course or any other written sources (e.g., books, websites). \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are not allowed to directly receive or give help during the test period.  In other words, all work must be your own, and you must not discuss or post any information about this test with anyone during the test period.\n",

    "- As a student, you alone are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your work and for understanding what [constitutes an academic offense](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity/academic-misconduct).\n",
