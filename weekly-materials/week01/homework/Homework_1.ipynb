    "# GG274 Homework 1: A Python Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first weekly homework assignment! You are encouraged to refer to lecture content and liberally use course resources such as the discussion board and office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks build off of content explored in lecture and in lab and give you an opportunity to practice with the material. Homeworks will contain tasks that focus on tools and knowledge described in lecture and lab that week. Data science knowledge is often cumulative, and you will be asked to refer to prior weeks' content (such as loading in datasets, which is something you're going to do a lot of in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks may also be continuations of the shorter labs done during that week, and will feature a relatively greater emphasis on application of tools, inquiry of concepts, and interpretation of your data science findings. Homeworks will feature a mix of coding and written response questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date**: The homework is due 23:59 on Monday, January 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit your work on [MarkUs](https://markus-ds.teach.cs.toronto.edu).\n",
    "To submit your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download this file (`Homework_1.ipynb`) from JupyterHub. (See [our JupyterHub Guide](../../../guides/jupyterhub_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",
    "2. Submit this file to MarkUs under the **hw1** assignment. (See [our MarkUs Guide](../../../guides/markus_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",
    "All homeworks will take place in a Jupyter notebook (like this one). When you are done, you will download this notebook and submit it to MarkUs.\n",
