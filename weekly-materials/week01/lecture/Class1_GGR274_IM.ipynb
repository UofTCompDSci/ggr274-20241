    "    - Vocabulary is much, much smaller\n",
    "    - Syntax/Grammar are much simpler\n",
    "    - The main limitation is that the computer (of pre-GPT era) is much more limited in understanding and thus more strict\n",
    "    - The real barrier is understanding what *you* want to do and explaining that in a *clear non-contradictory way*\n",
    "- In addition to writing code, we in this course and you, as you progress, should be learning **reading** code, and doing that effectively might be even more crucial\n",
    "    - Data Science tasks rarely start from a blank page\n",
    "    - You use, assimilate, and adapt the code and ideas of others\n",
    "    - Quite often, you are in a \"menu in an exotic restaurant\" situation, and that's okay!\n",
