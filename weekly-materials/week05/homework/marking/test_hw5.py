"""Automated tests for GGR274 Homework 5

Installation instructions (if running locally)
==============================================

This test script requires a few different libraries, which you can install with:

$ pip install pytest
$ pip install 'git+https://github.com/MarkUsProject/autotest-helpers.git#subdirectory=notebook_helper'
$ pip install 'git+https://github.com/UofTCompDSci/cds-testing'

After installing the libraries, you can run the tests in this file from the command line using:

$ pytest test_hw5.py
